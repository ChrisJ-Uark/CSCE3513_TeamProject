## Basics
* Initial version of University of Arkansas CSCE 3513 Team Project - Laser Tag program
* Intended only for use in Team 8 of UArk CSCE 3513, Fall 2022
* Program is incomplete. Major bugs are to be expected
* Program has currently only been tested on Windows 10 and Linux Cinnamon Mint so far
* Program requires latest pynput and tkinter modules to be installed
* Program is NOT intended to work on Mac OS

## Dependency Installation
* Tkinter should be installed with python3 by default
* If not installed on linux, use command: sudo apt-get install python-tk
* For pynput, install via pip: pip install pynput

## How to
* Run program by typing in commandline (without quotations): "python main.py"
* Use F7 to change between screens, including Splash
* Only the Edit Game screen has functionality as of now
* Edit Game functionality uses arrow keys, and Ins/Del as seen on the bottom part of the window

## Testing Needed
* More systems (test with multiple Windows/Linux computers)
* Ensure screen resolution is not an issue (current minimum: 1200x700)
* ... (More to be added)
